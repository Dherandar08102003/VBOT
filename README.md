# VBOT: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Chatbot for Institutional Data

**VBOT** is an AI-powered chatbot that enables users to query both structured and unstructured institutional data using natural language. By integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with Large Language Models (LLMs), VBOT provides accurate, context-aware, and document-grounded responses.

## 🚀 Features

- **Natural Language Querying**: Interact with institutional data using everyday language.
- **Structured & Unstructured Data Handling**: Seamlessly query SQL databases and unstructured documents like PDFs.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines vector-based retrieval with LLMs for precise answers.
- **Graph Database Integration**: Utilizes GraphDB for complex relationship queries (e.g., course structures, faculty-student mappings).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Engage with the chatbot through an intuitive chat interface.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dherandar08102003/VBOT.git
   cd VBOT
   ```
